ESP32-CAM QR Code MiSTer Game Launcher Project  

A DIY QR code reader using an ESP32-CAM module and a 3d printed case.  
Allows game launching on the MiSTer from a simple printed QR code over wifi.  
Provides a basic web interface to search for games and generate a QR code, configure MiSTer behaviour on game card removal, and setup MiSTer IP address.  

Uses the MiSTer Extensions Zaparoo API - [https://wiki.zaparoo.org/API](https://wiki.zaparoo.org/API)  - all credit goes to wizzoma for enabling this project with the Remote API.  

Project took about a day to complete and cost ~Â£25, which includes enough self laminating pouches for 100 QR Code Game Cards.  

Need soldering skills, and a working Arduino-IDE software.  

WIP Project - More details etc soon  

I did this just to see if it was possible, the NFC Zaparoo is a superior turn-key solution https://zaparoo.org/.
